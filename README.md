### Live Example
* [Billiard.js](http://foo123.github.com/examples/billiard.js/)

### Credits

*Since the original blog post about this project is closed, mention here some sources from which this was inspired and came to be*

This small demo project draws from various flash biliiard games (like graphic images etc.., I cheated a little :) )

However the primary sources are:

* **[AS3 Billiard by Alejantro](http://www.yoambulante.com/en/labs/elastic_collision.php)** (the similarity is obvious)
* **[Neraliu's](https://github.com/neraliu) NEngine.js** (not online at this time unfortunately), which provided a *Scene graph API* very similar to **Flash**

### TODO
* add ability to perform **draws** , **follows** and **sides** besides *normal* hits
* add ability for multiplayer game or player/computer game
* add sound
* make 3D billiard game (eg. Three.js)
