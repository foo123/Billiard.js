###Live Example
* [Billiard.js](http://foo123.github.com/examples/billiard.js/)

###Credits

*Since the original blog post about this project is closed, mention here some sources from which this was inspired and came to be*

This small demo project draws from various flash biliiard games (like graphic images etc.., i cheated a little :) )

However the primary sources are:

* **[AS3 Billiard by Alejantro](http://www.yoambulante.com/en/labs/elastic_collision.php)** (the similarity is obvious)
* **Neraliu's NEngine.js** (not online at this time unfortunately), which provided a *Scene graph API* very similar to **Flash**

*Cheers*


###TODO
* add sound
* make 3D billiard game (eg. Three.js)
